5 Minute keto pizza 
Ingredients:
Pizza Crust
2 large Eggs
2 tbsp. Parmesan Cheese
1 tbsp. Psyllium Husk Powder
1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning
Salt to Taste
2 tsp. Frying Oil Toppings
1.5 oz. Mozzarella Cheese
3 tbsp. Rao’s Tomato Sauce
1 tbsp. Freshly Chopped Basil
Method:
STEP 1
Measure out all dry ingredients into a bowl or container that can fit your immersion blender.
STEP 2
Add 2 eggs and mix everything together using your immersion blender. Make sure you continue blending for about 30 seconds, allowing the psyllium husk to absorb some of the liquid.
STEP 3
Heat 2 tsp. frying oil (I used bacon fat) in a pan over medium-high heat. Once very hot, spoon your mixture into the pan and spread out into a circle shape.
STEP 4
Once the edges have started to set and look slightly brown, flip the pizza crust. You can optionally transfer it to a plate and flip from there. Turn the broiler on high in the oven.
STEP 5
Cook on the opposite side for 30-60 seconds, then turn the stove off. Spoon 3 tbsp. Rao’s (or other low carb) tomato sauce over the pizza and spread.
STEP 6
Add cheese, then put pizza into the oven to broil. Leave a crack open in the oven so you can keep an eye on it. Once it’s bubbling, remove it from the oven.
STEP 7
Serve with some freshly chopped basil over the top!
