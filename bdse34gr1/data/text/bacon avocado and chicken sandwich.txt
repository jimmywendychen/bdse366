Bacon, avocado, and chicken sandwich 
Ingredients:
Keto Cloud Bread
3 large Eggs
3 oz. Cream Cheese
1/8 tsp. Cream of Tartar
1/4 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
The Filling
1 tbsp. Mayonnaise
1 tsp. Sriracha
2 slices Bacon
3 oz. Chicken
2 slices Pepper Jack Cheese
2 Grape Tomatoes
1/4 medium Avocado (about 2 oz.) 
Method:
STEP 1
Preheat the oven to 300F. Begin separating 3 eggs into to two clean, dry bowls.
STEP 2
Add cream for tartar and salt to the whites. Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites until you see soft, foamy peaks form.
STEP 3
In the other bowl, combine 3 oz. of cubed cream cheese with the egg yolks and beat until a pale yellow color.
STEP 4
Gently fold the egg whites into the yolks, half at a time.
STEP 5
On a parchment paper lined baking sheet, spoon about 1/4 cup of the keto cloud bread batter. This recipe makes 6 large keto cloud bread. 
STEP 6
Using a spatula, press gently on tops of the keto cloud bread to form squares. Then sprinkle the tops with garlic powder and bake for about 25 minutes. 
STEP 7
While the keto cloud bread are baking, cook the chicken and bacon with some salt and pepper.
STEP 8
To arrange the sandwich, begin by combining mayo and sriracha and spreading that onto the underside of one keto cloud bread. Add your chicken onto your mayo mixture.
STEP 9
Add 2 slices of pepper jack cheese and the bacon, nestle some halved grape tomatoes and spread mashed avocado on top. Season to taste, and top with the other keto cloud bread.
